## Downloading the datasets

### Automated downloading
To make life easier, run the ```setup.py``` script to download all the 
datasets and setup the directories the way our code handles it. The script shold be similar to the environment we used for the homeworks.
- Python version 3.11.5
- Requests, OS, zipfile, shutil libraries are required
- Make sure to run the file in this directory

### Manual downloading

For the Core Trends datasets, you will need to create an email to download the data. We've created a dummy throwaway email.
- Email: nacakak376@dxice.com
- Password: e28s"Fe-eDu;nS9

For the NSDUH datasets, there is no email required. However make sure to download the 'delimited' files since that's what we used
