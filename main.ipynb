    "After feeding the 2018 Core Trends data frame to the SVM model, we get a very low accuracy number. We're not entirely sure why this could be the case, but due to these results we plan on using Recursive Feature Elimination to help with finding the right columns to feed the model. For the results above, we are feeding it the internet frequency, the age, and which social medias they specifically use. There could be other responses that could help like, income, race, and marital status which are in the data.\n",
